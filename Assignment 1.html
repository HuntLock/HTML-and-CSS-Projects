		<p> The St. Johns Bridge is a steel suspension bridge that spans the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon, United States, between the Cathedral Park neighborhood in North Portland and the Linnton and Northwest Industrial neighborhoods in Northwest Portland. The steel suspension bridge with dual gothic-style towers is the tallest in Portland. </p>

<p>Here is a quote from Historic Bridges' website:</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://historicbridges.org/bridges/browser/?bridgebrowser=oregon/stjohnsbridge/">
		"Arguably one of the most beautiful bridges in the country, this bridge embodies the pinnacle of bridge aesthetics. Its beauty is solely derived from creating structural bridge elements that are themselves beautiful rather than adding superficial decorations to an ugly bridge structure."
